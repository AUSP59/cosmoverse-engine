# Code of Conduct

**Project:** COSMOVERSE ENGINE  
**Maintainer contacts:** @AUSP59 · alanursapu@gmail.com

## 1) Our pledge
We commit to a friendly, safe, and inclusive community where participants of every background can contribute and learn. Harassment or discrimination of any kind is not tolerated.

## 2) Our standards
**Positive behavior includes:**
- Showing empathy, kindness, and respect.
- Giving and accepting constructive feedback.
- Focusing on what is best for the project and community.
- Using inclusive language; being mindful of differing viewpoints and experiences.

**Unacceptable behavior includes:**
- Harassment, discrimination, or hate speech.
- Personal insults, trolling, or sustained disruption.
- Sexualized language or imagery; unwelcome advances.
- Publishing others’ private information (doxxing).
- Violence, threats, or encouragement of self-harm.
- Any illegal activity or encouragement thereof.

## 3) Scope
This Code applies to all community spaces and interactions related to the project, online and offline, including issues, PRs, discussions, chats, meetups, and private communications made in a project context.

## 4) Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards and taking appropriate, fair, and timely corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## 5) Reporting
If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:
- Email **alanursapu@gmail.com** (preferred), or
- Mention **@AUSP59** privately via GitHub.

Include: what happened, where, when, links/screenshots if possible, and whether it is ongoing. Reports are handled confidentially to the extent possible. Retaliation against reporters is prohibited.

**Initial acknowledgment:** within 48 hours (best effort).  
**Outcome communication:** we will inform the reporter of the outcome while respecting privacy.

## 6) Enforcement guidelines
When addressing violations, maintainers may use these community-impact levels:

1. **Correction** – A private, written notice; clarifies expected behavior.  
2. **Warning** – Official warning; continued behavior may lead to restrictions.  
3. **Temporary restrictions** – Time-limited removal of privileges (e.g., commenting, PRs, community spaces).  
4. **Permanent ban** – Removal from project spaces and contributions.

Maintainers may skip levels where behavior poses immediate risk. Appeals can be sent to **alanursapu@gmail.com**.

## 7) Safe participation
- If you feel unsafe, disengage and report.
- Do not escalate conflict; let moderators handle it.
- Respect requests to stop discussing a topic (“drop it” means drop it).

## 8) Privacy
Do not share report details beyond maintainers handling the case. We may keep minimal records for audit and pattern detection, in line with our Data/Privacy policies.

## 9) Attribution
This Code is adapted from community best practices (including the Contributor Covenant), tailored for COSMOVERSE ENGINE. See: https://www.contributor-covenant.org/ and https://www.mozilla.org/about/governance/policies/participation/
