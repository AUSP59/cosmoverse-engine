# Trust & Transparency
- Reproducible builds (diffoscope), SBOM (SPDX), provenance (SLSA), signed artifacts (cosign).
- No telemetry by default (see PRIVACY.md). Any opt-in features must be documented and off by default.
- Third-party deps are scanned (OSV-Scanner, scorecards). Pin versions where applicable.
